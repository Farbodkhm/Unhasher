# Unhasher
This program is useful to decrypt hashed value to original word.
This program only works on md5.

What is Decryption?

Decryption is the transformation of data that has been encrypted and rendered unreadable back to its unencrypted form. The garbled data is extracted by the system and converted and transformed into texts and images that are easily understandable by the reader as well as the system. Simply put, decryption is essentially the reverse of encryption, which requires coding data to make it unreadable, but the matching decryption keys can make it readable.

The recipients must have the right decryption or decoding tools to access the original details. Decryption is performed using the best decryption software, unique keys, codes, or passwords. The original file can be in the form of text files, images, e-mail messages, user data, and directories.

The original format is called plaintext while the unreadable format is referred to as ciphertext. Parties use an encryption scheme called an algorithm and keys for encryption and decryption of messages in a private conversation. The decryption algorithm is also known as a cipher.

Trie Data structure

Trie is an information retrieval data structure using which we can optimize search complexities.
Using Trie we can search key in O(L) time. but penality is storage requirements
Using Trie we can do a prefix-based search, we can sort lexicographically.
Using Hashtable also we can sort lexicographically but there we don't have prefix-based search and also regular hashtable take more space than trie.

What is MD5?

MD5 is a cryptographic hash function algorithm that takes the message as input of any length and changes it into a fixed-length message of 16 bytes. MD5 algorithm stands for the message-digest algorithm. MD5 was developed as an improvement of MD4, with advanced security purposes. The output of MD5 (Digest size) is always 128 bits. MD5 was developed in 1991 by Ronald Rivest.
