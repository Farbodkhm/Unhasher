What is Decryption?
Decryption is the transformation of data that has been encrypted and rendered unreadable back to its unencrypted form. The garbled data is extracted by the system and converted and transformed into texts and images that are easily understandable by the reader as well as the system. Simply put, decryption is essentially the reverse of encryption, which requires coding data to make it unreadable, but the matching decryption keys can make it readable.
The recipients must have the right decryption or decoding tools to access the original details. Decryption is performed using the best decryption software, unique keys, codes, or passwords. The original file can be in the form of text files, images, e-mail messages, user data, and directories.
The original format is called plaintext while the unreadable format is referred to as ciphertext. Parties use an encryption scheme called an algorithm and keys for encryption and decryption of messages in a private conversation. The decryption algorithm is also known as a cipher.
